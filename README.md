## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal images. Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes, and early detection can help prevent severe damage, including blindness. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled retinal images to classify the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy into different stages.

## Features
Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation of retinal images.
Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
Data Handling: Utilizes the Kaggle dataset of retinal images with labels for training.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
Visualization: Confusion matrix and ROC curves to visualize the performance of the model.# Instructions to be followed
